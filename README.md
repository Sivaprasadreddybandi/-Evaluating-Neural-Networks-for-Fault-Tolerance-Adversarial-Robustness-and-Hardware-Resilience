# -Evaluating-Neural-Networks-for-Fault-Tolerance-Adversarial-Robustness-and-Hardware-Resilience
Assessed robustness of DL models (CNN, ResNet18, Swin Transformer, etc.) against adversarial attacks and bit-flip errors. Used FGSM, PGD, SHAP, Grad-CAM, and uncertainty metrics to evaluate impact. Explored fine-tuning for recovery and model resilience.
